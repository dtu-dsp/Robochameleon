Most scripts in Robochameleon were developed for Matlab R2014a. However,
sometimes it's necessary to run the code on previous versions. This fol-
der is for functions included in R2014 but not earlier releases. If in-
cluded in the path, it will overwrite Matlab's native and presumably
faster functions, so this should only be done when absolutely necessary.
