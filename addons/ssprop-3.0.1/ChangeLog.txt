************************************************************
Version 3.0.1
************************************************************

Corrected a few bugs in the m-file sspropv.m (vector split-step
routine):  Renamed the variable "pol" to "psp" to match function
declaration, removed extraneous isscalar() line from code.
Updated the m-files to correctly refer to the two methods as
either 'circular' or 'elliptical'.

There were no changes made to the compiled code.

************************************************************
Version 3.0
************************************************************

This version now includes a vector version of the code, which
allows one to simulate effects like PDL, PMD, birefringence,
nonlinear polarization rotation, and cross-polarization
modulation.  The scalar routines are largely unmodified.

Code has been updated to use the latest FFTW 3.1.2 routines.

************************************************************
Version 2.0.2
************************************************************

This version introduces no changes to the core calculation
routine, only in the associated utilities and examples.

Fixed bug in solitonpulse utility.  This utility program was
incorrectly implementing the chirp factor for chirped pulses.

The examples directory now includes 28 files that reproduce many
of the simulation results presented in chapters 3..5 of
G. P. Agrawal's text, Nonlinear Fiber Optics (3rd ed.) 

************************************************************
Version 2.0.1
************************************************************

Added utility file wspace.m that produces a vector of angular
frequencies for use with the FFT routines

sspropc now recognizes empty ([]) arguments for toptical and
traman.  This allows the user to specify maxiter and tol while
leaving toptical and traman unspecified.

Added support for frequency-dependent loss alpha(w).  If the
input parameter alpha is a vector with the same length as u0,
then it is treated as a frequency-dependent loss coefficient.
Otherwise if alpha is a scalar, then all frequency components
have the same loss.

Added support for arbitrary specification of dispersion function
beta(w).  If beta is a vector with the same length as u0, then it
is regarded as a direct specification of the propagation
constant.  Otherwise, beta is interpreted as the Taylor-series
coefficients of the dispersion polynomial.

************************************************************
Version 2.0
************************************************************

sspropc now uses FFTW 3.1 routines

single- and double- precision versions can be compiled from the
same source file.  Use -DSINGLEPREC when compiling to build
single-precision (float) version.

wisdom file is renamed to "fftw-wisdom.dat" and
"fftwf-wisdom.dat" for double and single-precision routines
respectively.  

wisdom file is not automatically saved when you exit from the
program.  User must save the file manually.

Added special command-line arguments for specifying the FFTW
planner method.  (-estimate, -exhaustive, -measure, -patient),
default method is patient.

Added special command-line arguments for controlling wisdom:
(-savewisdom, -loadwisdom, -forgetwisdom)

Memory allocation hooks are no longer needed with this version of
FFTW 3.1
