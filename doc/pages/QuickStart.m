%> \section Overview Overview
%> 
%> Robochameleon is a coding framework and component library for simulation 
%> and experimental analysis of optical communication systems.  This is a 
%> quick start guide to using the framework; descriptions of components
%> can be found in the corresponding class definitions.
%>
%> We use classes to ensure standardization for both signal representation
%> and functions.  This guide has a brief introduction to classes, but if
%> you are familiar with object oriented programming, you should skip it.
%>
%> \tableofcontents
%> 
%> \section Setup Setting up
%> The Robochameleon project is stored in multiple folders, which all must
%> be in Matlab's search path for the code to run.  The script 
%> robochameleon.m will automatically add these to the path.  
%>
%> There are also some toolbox  dependencies, as well as some function calls 
%> to relatively new features in Matlab.  When possible, we have added 
%> alternatives in the _compatibility_ folder.  The initialization script 
%> does some automatic detection of what features the user has, but is not 
%> perfect, and in some cases it might be necessary to add these folders 
%> manually.  In particular, [module] uses the bioinformatics toolbox, so the
%> folder \\compatibility\\bioinfolite should be in the path if the user
%> does not have a license.
%> 
%> \section Classes Classes
%> Classes ensure standardization for a large function library.  
%> They facilitate block data processing and internal state saving.  
%> For a complete introduction to classes using Matlab, there are some useful tutorials on [Matlab Central](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/).
%> 
%> Here is a very simple (and totally useless) example of a class that adds two numbers together:
%> @code
%> classdef Adder
%> 
%>     properties
%>         a;
%>         b;
%>         sum;
%>      end
%>     
%>     methods
%>         function obj = Adder(param)
%>             obj.a = param.a;
%>             obj.b = param.b;            
%>         end
%>         
%>         function obj = plus(obj)
%>              obj.sum = obj.a+obj.b
%>         end
%>     end
%> end
%> @endcode
%> 
%> A class basically consists of two things:
%> 1. Properties.  These are analogous to parameters passed to a function.
%> 2. Methods.  These are analogous to functions.  
%> 
%> All classes must have a method (called the constructor) that creates an object of that class.  In the above example, that was:
%> @code
%>         function obj = Adder(param)
%>             obj.a = param.a;
%>             obj.b = param.b;            
%>         end
%> @endcode
%> 
%> In the above example, there is an additional method called <code>plus</code> that contains the main function.  
%> To use this class, one would first make an adder using the constructor:
%> @code
%> >> test=Adder(struct('a', 1, 'b', 3));
%> >> test
%> test = 
%>   Adder
%>   Properties:
%>     a: 1
%>     b: 3
%>     sum: []
%>   Methods
%> @endcode
%> 
%> Note the addition has not been performed yet.  Then to perform the pre-defined operation:
%> @code
%> >> test.plus
%> ans = 
%>   Adder
%>   Properties:
%>     a: 1
%>     b: 3
%>     sum: 4
%>   Methods
%> @endcode
%> 
%> Note all other operations are prohibited:
%> @code
%> >> test.minus
%> No appropriate method, property, or field minus for class adder.
%> @endcode
%> 
%> \section Roboclasses Robochameleon classes
%>
%> In Robochameleon, there are four basic classes:
%> 1. [pwr] (@ref pwr) for representing signal power
%> 2. [signal_interface](@ref signal_interface) for representing a waveform
%> 3. [unit](@ref unit) for representing an element in a communication system
%> 4. [module](@ref module) a collection of units, including connections between them
%>
%> Clicking the above links will take you to the full reference pages for
%> each class with documentation of all properties and methods.  Below, we 
%> have a more general introduction to the most important properties and
%> methods, as well as descriptions of how these are meant to interact.
%>
%> 
%> \section SigRep Signal representation
%>
%> Signals are described using two classes, pwr, and signal_interface.
%> Each signal_interface object has a property (signal_interface::PCol) 
%> that is an array of pwr objects.  An array is used so that one pwr 
%> object describes the power contained in each each component (polarization) 
%> of the waveform.
%> 
%> \subsection PowerRep Power representation (pwr)
%>
%> Typically signal power is represented as an object of type [pwr] (@ref pwr).  
%> The two main properties are 
%> 1. the signal-to-noise ratio, and 
%> 2. the signal power.  
%> 
%> Note that the SNR is not always well-defined (e.g. this value doesn't mean much after propagation through a nonlinear channel). 
%> The primary purpose of tracking SNR is to help understand what limits performance of a simulated system, but sometimes 
%> some discretion in interpreting this value is required.  
%> 
%> The signal power and noise powers are defined as the total powers in the bandwidth of the signal waveform (i.e. the sampling rate Fs).
%> Thus if a large oversampling ratio (e.g. 16 samples per symbol) is used, then the SNR of the signal will be 
%> much worse than the SNR of an equivalent signal in a real system.
%> 
%> There are a number of useful methods in the [pwr] (@ref pwr) class, including addition, scalar multiplication, and several display and unit conversion functions.
%> These are documented in the class itself.  For an example of how to use [pwr] (@ref pwr)  objects, consult run_Testpwr.m in \\Setups\\Demo.
%> 
%> \subsection Waveforms Other signal properties (signal_interface)
%> 
%> All signals must be represented as objects of type [signal_interface](@ref signal_interface).
%> They have the following user-specified properties:
%> 1. E, the waveform (in arbitrary units)
%> 2. Fs, the sampling rate (Hz)
%> 3. Fc, the carrier frequency (Hz)
%> 4. Rs, the symbol rate (Hz)
%> 5. PCol, the signal power (array of pwr objects)
%> 
%> These quantites are also not always well-defined (e.g. the output of a laser has no symbol rate), but are nonetheless required.
%> signal_interface objects also have some derived properties:
%> 6. N number of signal elements (polarizations)
%> 7. Nss number of samples per symbol
%> 8. ...
%> 
%> which can be read and used but not modified.
%> 
%> Here is a very simple example of how to construct a signal interface object and what the display function looks like:
%> 
%> @code
%> >> sig_param = struct('Rs',10e9,'Fs',40e9,'Fc',const.c/1550e-9, 'PCol', [pwr(inf, 27), pwr(inf, 27)]);
%> >> sig_mat = randn(100,2); % 2-component random signal
%> >> sig_obj = signal_interface(sig_mat,sig_param)
%> 
%> Real signal
%>               Length: 100 Sa
%> Number of components: 2
%>          Symbol rate: 10.0 GBd (100.0 ps)
%>        Sampling rate: 40.00 GHz (25.00 ps)
%>   Oversampling ratio: 4.00 Sa/symbol
%>    Carrier frequency: 193.414 THz (1.55000 um)
%> 
%> Total power: 30.03 dBm (1006.49 mW)
%> SNR: Inf dB (Inf)
%> Signal power: 30.03 dBm (1006.49 mW)
%> Noise power: -Inf dBm (0.00 mW)
%> >>
%> @endcode
%> 
%> There are a number of useful methods in [signal_interface](@ref signal_interface) that are documented there.  
%> Most notably, there are methods to apply functions to signals and add signals to each other such that power and SNR are tracked automatically.
%> 
%> \subsection PwrVsE Relationship between power and waveform
%> 
%> Note that the waveform amplitude (signal_interface::PCol) is specified separately from the waveform shape (signal_interface::E).  
%> This can lead to un-intended results when the two are in conflict.  
%> It is important to always use the appropriate get and set-like (signal_interface::fun1, signal_interface::plus, signal_interface::mtimes) methods when manipulating waveforms.
%> 
%> For an extended example, see run_TestSignalInterface.m and run_TestSignalInterfaceAdvanced.m  in \\Setups\\Demo
%> 
%> 
%> \section Blocks Block-based program structure (units & modules)
%>
%> Every function that can be applied to a signal_interface object is
%> encapsulated in a [unit](@ref unit).  Multiple units can be collected into a
%> super-unit, which is called a [module](@ref module).
%>
%> \subsection Units Units (unit)
%> 
%> Everything that operates on a signal_interface object should be defined 
%> as a  class that inherits certain properties from [unit].  For example:
%> @code
%> classdef MyClass_v1 < unit
%> ...
%> end
%> @endcode
%> 
%> All units must have the following properties:
%> - nInputs
%>  - Number of inputs
%> - nOutputs 
%>  - Number of ouputs
%>
%> Units must also have the following method (in addition to the constructor):
%>
%> - traverse
%> 
%> Traverse acts like main in c programs.  It defines what function the
%> unit performs on the signal.  The only allowable inputs and outputs of
%> traverse are of type signal_interface.  This is necessary to ensure cross-
%> compatibility between units written by different people, as well as module
%> construction.  Everything else should be an object property.
%>
%> There are a number of properties automatically included in all units.
%> The ones relevant to the user are:
%> 
%> * draw 
%>      * This should be used to enable/disable plotting (true=plot)
%> * results 
%>      * This is a structure that should be used to store information 
%> calculated/gathered by the unit during traverse.  Using a general
%> structure for this task is sometimes more convenient than using object
%> properties.
%>
%> \subsection Modules Modules (module)
%>
%> A module is a collection of connected units.  Modules can contain other modules.
%>
%> A module definition will only have a constructor.  The constructor has
%> three parts: 
%>
%> 1. A series of constructors for constituent units
%> 2. A series of connections between units
%> 3. The command exportModule
%>
%> For example:
%>
%> @code
%> classdef MyModule_v1 < module
%>     
%>     properties
%>         nInputs = 2;
%>         nOutputs = 4;
%>     end
%>     
%>     methods
%>         function obj = MyModule_v1(param)
%>             % Units
%>             a = A(param.paramA);
%>             b = B(param.paramB);
%>             c = C(param.paramC);
%>             d = D(param.paramD);
%>             
%>             % Connections
%>             obj.connectInputs({a b},[1 1])
%>             a.connectOutputs(c,1);
%>             b.connectOutputs(c,2);
%>             c.connectOutputs({d obj.outputBuffer obj.outputBuffer},[1 3 4])
%>             d.connectOutputs({obj.outputBuffer obj.outputBuffer},[1 2]);
%>             
%>             obj.exportModule();
%>         end
%>     end
%>     
%> end
%> @endcode
%>
%> creates a module with the following connection diagram:
%>
%> \image html "RoboBlocks.png" "Module example"
%>
%> A module is itself a unit. Enabling unit::draw for a module will plot a 
%> system diagram (biograph) when the constructor is called.  These do not
%> close with <code> close all </code>, but can be removed with <code>
%> close_biographs </code>.
%>  
%> 
%> \section Consts Accessing constants
%> 
%> There is an additional class in base called [const](@ref const) where physical constants in standard SI units are stored.
%> 
%> For example, to use the speed of light, enter <code> const.c </code>.
%>
